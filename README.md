# Replicate Node.js client

A Node.js client for [Replicate](https://replicate.com/). It lets you run models from your Node.js apps and do various other things on Replicate.

## Status

**This is an early alpha. The implementation might change between versions
without warning. Please use at your own risk and pin to a specific version if
you're relying on this for anything important!**

## Usage

Install with `npm install replicate`

Set your API token as an environment variable called `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`.

### Making preedictions

To run a prediction and return its output:

```js
import replicate from "replicate";

const prediction = await replicate
  .model(
    "stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"
  )
  .predict({
    input: {
      prompt: "an astronaut riding on a horse",
    },
  });

console.log(prediction.output);
// "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/nSREat5H54rxGJo1kk2xLLG2fpr0NBE0HBD5L0jszLoy8oSIA/out-0.png"
```

If you want to do something like updating progress while the prediction is
running, you can pass in an `onUpdate` callback function:

```js
import replicate from "replicate";

await replicate
  .model(
    "stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"
  )
  .predict(
    {
      input: {
        prompt: "an astronaut riding on a horse",
      },
    },
    {
      onUpdate: (prediction) => {
        console.log(prediction.output);
      },
    }
  );
```

If you'd prefer to control your own polling you can use the low-level
`createPrediction()` method:

```js
import replicate from "replicate";

const prediction = await replicate
  .model(
    "stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"
  )
  .createPrediction({
    input: {
      prompt: "an astronaut riding on a horse",
    },
  });

console.log(prediction.status); // "starting"
```

From there, you can fetch the current status of the prediction using
`await prediction.load()` or `await replicate.prediction(prediction.id).load()`.

#### Webhooks

You can also provide webhook configuration to have Replicate send POST requests
to your service when certain events occur:

```js
import replicate from "replicate";

await replicate
  .model(
    "stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"
  )
  .createPrediction(
    {
      input: {
        prompt: "an astronaut riding on a horse",
      },
    },
    {
      // See https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#create-prediction--webhook
      webhook: "https://your.host/webhook",

      // See https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#create-prediction--webhook_events_filter
      webhookEventsFilter: ["output", "completed"],
    }
  );
```
